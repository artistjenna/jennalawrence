                <p class="italics">“I think Jenna does a good job. I especially appreciate her focus and how she likes to organize her work. Jenna will hold sync up meetings on her work with key stakeholders before her delivery which I think is really really good to make sure we aren’t going the wrong way. I think she brings a level of excitement and passion to those meetings, showing of her designs and really shows an appreciation for our product direction. I like how she digs in and gets invested in what we want to do for our customers.”</p>
